## CellBricks Documentation

The CellBricks project re-examines the cellular provider landscape. Currently, a small number of 
mobile network operators, or MNOs, dominate the cellular provider industry. Small players and new 
entrants are challenged by the vast infrastructure costs needed to expand service. The CellBricks 
protocol aims to significantly reduce the barrier of entry by decoupling physical infrastructure 
from user management and billing.

This site organizes the source code, step-by-step experimental procedure, 
and data for the CellBricks project.
